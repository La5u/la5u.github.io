AI generated content is harder to distinguish every day. Here are some websites I can recommend to practice:

### Easy
- [WhichFaceIsReal.com](https://whichfaceisreal.com/) — Faces

### Medium
- [Microsoft Real or Not](https://www.realornotquiz.com/)
- [SightEngine](https://sightengine.com/ai-or-not)
- [AIvsReal](https://ai-vs-real.com/)

### Hard
- [Reality Check](https://realitycheckk.replit.app) — newer models
