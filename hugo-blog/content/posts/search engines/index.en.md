Google has AI results, tracking, and advertisements. It's time to switch to an alternatives:
### Paid Search Engines:
- [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) - Customizable search engine with no advertisements or tracking. AI results are filtered automatically. Most relevant results in my experience.

### Free Search Engines:
- [Ecosia](https://ecosia.org/) - Ads pay for forests. All searches encrypted.
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) - Privacy-focused search engine, AI can be disabled.
- [StartPage](https://startpage.com/) - Google proxy, without tracking. Depends on Google.

### Self hosting:
- [Whoogle](https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search) - Google without bloating.
- [Searx](https://github.com/searx/searx) - completely open source.
